The best way to ace this course is to cement your concepts, and make sure you get enough practice. A strong pre-requisite, that I believe, to this course, is A-Levels Maths (Mechanics) and Physics. 

Also, make sure to make your own notes, as you go along, and cross reference them with credible resources, preferably the coursebooks that the instructor recommends.
