# ðŸ–¥ Lab Tasks
## Task # 1
You are developing a system to manage two bank accounts. Due to an error in the transaction 
processing, the balances of two accounts have been swapped. To correct this, you need to 
implement a function that, using call by reference, swaps the balances of the two accounts. 
Before and after calling the function, print the balances of both accounts to verify that the 
swap has been successfully reversed. 

**Solution**: `lab_task_1.cpp`

## Task # 2
Imagine you're developing a banking system where users can request adjustments to their 
account balances. You need to create two different functions: 
One function that takes the account balance as input and doubles it temporarily (without 
changing the actual balance in the system). 
Another function that doubles the account balance and updates it permanently. 
To demonstrate this, you need to print the account balance before and after calling each 
function in the main program. This will help highlight the difference between temporary and 
permanent changes in balance adjustments. Write a c++ program for the banking system.

**Solution**: `lab_task_2.cpp`

## Task # 3
You are developing a simple console application to manage student grades. The application allows teachers to enter student reg number and grades, calculate the average grade for each 
student, and determine if they are eligible for honors based on their average grade. 
- Input Student reg number and Grades: 
    - Allow the teacher to enter multiple students along with their grades. 
- Calculate Average Grade: 
    - Compute the average grade for each student. 
- Determine Honors Eligibility: 
    - Check if the average grade is 90 or above for honors.


**Solution**: `lab_task_3.cpp`
